## 📌 Project Overview

In this project, I analyzed a dataset on student academic performance using:
- 📊 **Statistics** for distribution analysis and hypothesis testing
- 🐍 **Python** for EDA and visualizations
- 🛢️ **SQL** for deep querying and slicing the data

The goal was to identify key factors influencing student outcomes and suggest actionable insights for educational improvement.

## 📂 Dataset

- Source: Open-source educational datasets (e.g., UCI, Kaggle)
- Records: ~1,000 students
- Features: Gender, Parent Education Level, Study Time, Test Scores, etc.

## 🔍 Key Areas of Analysis

### 🧮 Statistical Analysis
- Descriptive stats: mean, median, mode, standard deviation
- Correlation analysis between study time, parental education, and grades
- Normality tests and visual distributions
- 📌 **Chi-square** and **t-tests** to validate significance of findings

### 🐍 Python (EDA & Visualizations)
- Libraries: `Pandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`
- Plotted histograms, box plots, scatter plots
- Identified:
  - 📈 Trends in performance by gender
  - 🕒 Impact of study hours on test results
  - 👨‍👩‍👧 Influence of parental background

### 🧾 SQL Analysis
- Used MySQL for:
  - Aggregation by gender, class, and parental education
  - Conditional filtering using `CASE` and `GROUP BY`
  - Created views for top/bottom performing students
  - 📊 Ranked students using `RANK()` and `NTILE()` functions

---

## 📈 Insights

- 🧑‍🎓 Female students slightly outperformed males in writing and reading scores
- 🕒 Students who studied more than 10 hours/week scored 15–20% higher on average
- 👨‍🏫 Higher parental education level was positively correlated with student scores
- 🍕 Lunch type and test preparation course also showed moderate influence

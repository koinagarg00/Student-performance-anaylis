- 📊 *Data Visualization*

  Our goal? 

- To extract meaningful insights from raw data and understand what drives student success!


## 🛠 Tech Stack

- *Python* (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- *SQL* (SQLite, MYSQL)
- *Jupyter Notebook*


📂 Dataset Features

The dataset includes the following attributes:

👦 Gender

🎓 Parental level of education

🧠 Test preparation course

📐 Math score

📖 Reading score

✍ Writing score


🔍 Key Insights

Here are just a few insights we discovered:

Students who completed test prep performed significantly better.

Parental education level has a positive correlation with student scores.

Math, reading, and writing scores are strongly interrelated.
